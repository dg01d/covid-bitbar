# Covid Bitbar

A quick bitbar plugin to access covid statistics.

I don't really want this to go into the official repo, but feel free to
download this and place in your bitbar plugins folder.

To set your country's identifier, check the country name on the api provider,
and replace `$state` on line 31 with your own country code.

Needs SteveEdson's BitBar php framework.
